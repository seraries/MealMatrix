# MealMatrix
Need meal ideas? This is a paleo meal matrix that helps generate meal ideas via intriguing combinations of foods.

This is running on my website, richardsonprogramming.com. It's a work in progress and the first order of business is to change the table structure in the database (and the corresponding SQL code) to allow multiple 
users to have different foods show up in their individual matrices. I'll also be implementing a login page soon to 
facilitate this.

I also want to add the Spring framework, and perhaps a front end framework like Angular JS. Additionally, maybe use 
Hibernate. 

If anyone has an idea for more functionality they'd like to see, please let me know!!
