# MealMatrix
Need meal ideas? This is a paleo meal matrix that helps generate meal ideas via intriguing combinations of foods.

This is running on my website, richardsonprogramming.com. It's a work in progress and the next order of business is 
to add the Spring framework, and perhaps a front end framework like AngularJS. Additionally, maybe use Hibernate. 

I also am considering re-doing the login/register functionality to support passwords, but want to make sure I've learned
how to utilize best practices for encryption first.

And I would like to add the ability for users to specify the serving size of each food if they end of making the randomly
generated meal, so that I can export that data to the user's choice of calorie-tracking app (loseit, myfitnesspal) to 
make it easier for them to log the nutritional info of each meal.

If anyone has ideas for other functionality they'd like to see, please let me know!!
